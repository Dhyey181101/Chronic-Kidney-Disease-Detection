Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a serious threat to global health, with high rates of 
morbidity and mortality and the emergence of new diseases as a result. CKD develops when a sickness or 
illness damages the kidney, inhibits kidney function, and interferes with the kidney's normal operation. This 
occurs over several months or years. Early diagnosis of CKD can help with timely treatment. Doctors can 
benefit greatly from machine learning models because to their quick and precise recognition capabilities.  
Methods In this study the authors propose a machine learning model for the proper diagnosis of CKD. The 
models are implemented on 400 patients belonging to different classes. The data is hosted at the University of 
California Irvine (UCI) database for renal disease prediction. There were various models deployed and 
Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) proved to be most effective among them. Also numerous 
pre-processing methods like Outlier Analysis, Feature Selection and SMOTE were applied on dataset before 
implementing models. 
Results The models were analysed using 5 different parameters viz. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, 
and the results demonstrate that both approaches might be successfully used in a clinical situation, with the 
probabilistic approach producing accuracy of 100% for (RF) and 98.75% for (LR) allowing for more specific 
grading of a probable prognosis of chronic kidney disease. 
Conclusion The current study demonstrated how, when compared to conventional kidney disease screening, 
the use of prediction machines can help with early diagnosis and prioritised care for individuals with renal 
disease while also providing cost-saving benefits. The proposed clinical cybernetic loop would now need to 
be further validated, and the prediction machine would need to be improved by investigating non-linear 
dimensions embedding and clustering techniques and currently the survey is limited to 400 patients further 
more research could be done by taking into consideration more diverse patients belonging to different 
communities and having disparate dietary habits.
