# Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis with Machine Learning

## Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a significant global health challenge, characterized by high rates of morbidity and mortality. It develops over months or years due to damage to the kidneys, leading to impaired kidney function. Early diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment. Machine learning models offer quick and accurate diagnosis capabilities, which can greatly benefit healthcare professionals.

## Methods
In this study, the authors propose a machine learning model for diagnosing CKD. The models are trained on a dataset of 400 patients from different classes, sourced from the University of California Irvine (UCI) database for renal disease prediction. Various preprocessing methods, including outlier analysis, feature selection, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), are applied to the dataset before implementing the models. Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) are identified as the most effective models.

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using five different parameters: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score. The results demonstrate promising outcomes, with the probabilistic approach achieving an accuracy of 100% for RF and 98.75% for LR. These results indicate the potential utility of these approaches in clinical settings, offering specific grading of a probable prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the potential of machine learning models in aiding early diagnosis and prioritized care for individuals with renal disease. By leveraging prediction machines, healthcare providers can realize cost-saving benefits and improve patient outcomes. However, further validation of the proposed clinical cybernetic loop and improvement of prediction machines through investigation of non-linear dimensions embedding and clustering techniques are warranted. Additionally, future research could involve a more diverse patient population with varying dietary habits and community backgrounds.
